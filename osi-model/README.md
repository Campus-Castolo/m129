# test questions
I asked ChatGPT to make me some test questions regarding the OSI-Model

1. **Multiple Choice:**
   - Which layer of the OSI model is responsible for the physical transmission of data over a network medium?
     - A) Data Link
     - B) Physical
     - C) Transport
     - D) Network

**Answer**<br>
B would be the answer

2. **Matching:**
   - Match the following devices to the correct OSI layer:
     - 1) Router
     - 2) Ethernet card
     - 3) Web browser
     - A) Physical
     - B) Network
     - C) Application

**Answer**<br>
the answer would be:

**1 --> B**

**2 --> A**

**3 --> C**

3. True or False

| Statement | True | False |
|-----------|------|-------|
| The Presentation layer is responsible for framing data into packets. | | ✓ |
| IP (Internet Protocol) operates at the Transport layer of the OSI model. | | ✓ |
| The Network layer provides logical addressing for device identification. | ✓ | |
| TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connectionless protocol. | | ✓ |
| The Physical layer deals with the establishment, management, and termination of sessions between applications. | | ✓ |
| SSL/TLS protocols are associated with the Session layer. | | ✓ |
| Hubs operate at the Data Link layer of the OSI model. | ✓ | |
| ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is primarily used for error detection and correction. | | ✓ |
| The Application layer provides network services to applications. | ✓ | |
| UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a reliable transport protocol. | | ✓ |


4. **Fill in the Blank:**
   - The ________ layer of the OSI model provides logical addressing and routing of packets through the network.

   **Answer**

    The third layer (Networking)

5. **Short Answer:**
   - Explain the role of the Presentation layer in the OSI model.

  This layer translates data into a format understandable by the receiving application, managing data encryption and decryption. SSL/TLS and MPEG are examples of protocols in this layer.

6. **Matching:**
   - Match the following protocols to their respective OSI layers:
     - 1) TCP
     - 2) HTTP
     - 3) Ethernet
     - A) Transport
     - B) Application
     - C) Data Link

     **Answer**

     **1 --> A**

     **2 --> B**
     
     **3 --> C**

7. **Multiple Choice:**
   - Which layer ensures the reliable delivery of packets and controls data flow?
     - A) Transport
     - B) Data Link
     - C) Presentation
     - D) Session

    **Answer**

    The answer would be **A**

8. **Short Answer:**
   - Provide an example of a device that operates at the Presentation layer of the OSI model and describe its role.

   An example of a device that operates at the Presentation layer is a media player. The media player is responsible for interpreting and presenting multimedia data in a format that can be understood by the user. At the Presentation layer, the media player handles tasks such as data encryption and decryption, data compression, and formatting, ensuring that audio and video files are presented correctly to the user.

9. **Matching:**
    - Match the following protocols to their corresponding layers in the OSI model:
      - 1) SSL/TLS
      - 2) ICMP
      - 3) FTP
      - A) Presentation
      - B) Network
      - C) Application

    **1 --> A**

    **2 --> B**

    **3 --> C**
